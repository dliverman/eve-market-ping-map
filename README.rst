EVE Market Data Relay Ping Map (EMDRPM)
=======================================

:Author: Dylan Liverman

This application consists of a WebGL-based map of EVE that lights up when
market data arrives through EMDR. Each dot on the map represents a system,
and the brightness of each system shows how recently we saw data from it.

Each dot fades over about a minute.
